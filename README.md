# Journey

The super app where your path to a healthier lifestyle starts.
A case study by Razvan Ivan (ID: 40096278) and Cosmin Sustac (ID: 40097001)

# Introduction

Since the launch of the first iPhone back in 2007, it can be argued that smartphones are constantly revolutionizing our way of life, now more than ever. Having a mini super computer that is a smartphone in your pocket at all times is incredibly powerful since it allows its user to have instant access to many applications at the touch of a fingertip. Banking, transportation, food ordering, exercising, etc. are all areas that mobile applications make a lot more accessible to people, wherever they are. As such, super apps, which are applications that regroup and connect other applications all in one place, have become incredibly popular in the Asian world since they streamline the needs of people by having them visit only one application.

## The Problem

While the benefits of smartphones and their applications cannot be overstated, their popular uprising has led many people to become dependent on those mobile apps, causing them to develop unhealthy lifestyles. High screen-time can become a serious issue for many as well as sedentarism which is encouraged since nearly everything you need can be brought to you via mobile apps, foregoing the need to go outside and do it yourself. With some applications trying to keep you on your phone as much as possible, trying to live a healthy lifestyle has become more challenging.

## The Solution

Based on the super app model which regroups many app functionalities all under one roof, we have decided to create an ecosystem that promotes healthy living habits all the while providing important user features such as navigation, wallet, exercising, messaging, and cooking. The Journey super app will help users in their journey towards a healthier lifestyle by allowing them to set goals/milestones and screen-time restrictions as well as to collect healthy points by using the various features of the app which can then be redeemed towards real money. Instead of having to look left and right for applications and advice that will help you to become a healthier version of yourself, Journey makes you avoid all of that by being a one-stop-shop.

# Product and User Research

Research is an integral part of any project and so that is where we started our journey to make a health-oriented super app. Our approach was to first start with a few known super apps and to analyze them. Then, we decided to send out a survey and do a few interviews in order to gather the opinions of people with regards to their screen habits and the aspects that they prioritize in their life in order to have a healthy lifestyle. All of this knowledge would then allow us to create various artifacts such as user personas, user journeys, etc.

## Current Market

First things first, before getting to know our user base and starting our design, it was important that we get a clear picture of what super apps are out there so that we could learn from them.

There are a few major players in the super app scene which is mostly located in the Asian world. We have chosen to look at WeChat, Gojek, Grab, and Line in order to analyze the most important features that they have. This would in turn allow us to select the most popular ones, but most importantly, the ones that fit the most into an ecosystem that promotes a healthy lifestyle. We would like to highlight this fact since we haven’t been able to find any super app that focuses on healthy living and therefore, some of the features of the previously mentioned applications might not be suitable for what we are trying to achieve.

## Surveys
After having done some market research in order to study existing super apps and to gain a deeper understanding on the subject, it was now the time to see what some of the views of the population were towards super apps and towards different aspects that make-up a healthy lifestyle. In order to do this, we created a survey using Google Forms and shared it online. We managed to survey 32 participants and here are the results of the questions that we asked:
List all the questions one after the other here.

<p align="center">Question 1:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q1.png?raw=true">
</p>

Q1: First off, we can see that the market for a healthy super app is there since more than half of the respondents are interested or very interested in such an application. This is great news because we would be off to a rough start if this wasn’t the case.
<br/>

<p align="center">Questions 2, 3, 4, 5:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q2.png?raw=true">

  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q5.png?raw=true">
</p>

Q2, 3, 4, 5: As it can be seen, the large majority answered that they give a lot of priority to their physical and mental health and that healthy cooking and exercising are very important in people’s lives. This highlights the importance of such a super app as Journey because it will allow its users to continue prioritizing what is important to them.
<br/>

<p align="center">Question 6:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q6.png?raw=true">
</p>

Q6: We noticed that quite an important percentage of people found that having access to a virtual doctor/psychiatrist is important to them which made us seriously consider it as a possible main feature of the super app. However, we decided that the access to a virtual doctor/psychiatrist could perhaps shift the focus of the super app from guiding people towards a healthy lifestyle to providing people with remote medical access which is not the goal of Journey. We believed that that feature would better serve people if it was a standalone application where the help provided could be much more extensive.
<br/>

<p align="center">Questions 7, 8:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q7.png?raw=true">
  <img src="https://github.com/N0ot-No0t/Soen357-MiniProject/blob/main/assets/survey_questions/q8.png?raw=true">
</p>

Q7, 8: The above bar graph highlights the question on which participants were the most divided. Half the participants said that they accorded little to no importance towards regulating digital screen time while the other half said the opposite which was that regulating digital screen time is important or very important to them. With that in mind, the participants then answered how many hours on average of screen time they incorporate in their daily lives and the numbers are sky high. Slightly more than 40% of people answered that they were in front of a screen for 11 hours or more per hour while more than 30% of people answered in between 7-10. It can be hypothesized that these numbers are very high due to the current pandemic which has forced many people to work remotely and that means being in front of a screen for 8 hours or so at the very least. In the end, screen time is definitely a very pressing concern, now more than ever.
<br/>

<p align="center">Questions 9, 10, 11, 12:</p>

</p>

Q9, 10, 11, 12: In the case of Maslow’s pyramid of needs, the participants’ responses were relatively spread out into the four top categories of the pyramid. Then, people generally answered that being sociable, going outside, travelling, and maintaining a constant and healthy sleep schedule are very important things for them when it comes to a healthy lifestyle and this seems to converge with the findings from the question about Maslow’s pyramid.

</p>

Q13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20: We decided to ask some more specific questions about the super app itself and saw that people were somewhat likely or likely to listen and incorporate healthy lifestyle advice from Journey which was expected. People may often be reserved when it comes to taking advice from unfamiliar sources and we believe that the right advice in combination with a good UI/UX experience is what will improve this outlook.

Afterwards, the participants answered that effectiveness, utility, and learnability were the usability criteria that they would be looking forward to the most in the super app. Additionally, they also answered that helpful, motivating, and rewarding were the most important criterias that would be used to define their goals when using Journey.
Finally, close to the majority of people agreed that lifestyle apps (such as Fitness, Dating, Food, Music, Travel, etc.) were the ones that encouraged healthy habits the most and that they were the best for their overall well being. The participants then said that both lifestyle apps and games/entertainment apps contributed the most to their overall happiness. Additionally, 75% of users agreed that social media apps were the most detrimental to their well being.

# User Analysis
Now that we were armed with the knowledge that came from the product and user research, we decided to create a few clear profiles of who our three most relevant user are and to try to create various artifacts in hopes of getting a better idea of the kind of people that would use our healthy super app as well as what they would do, think, and feel.

## Personas
With the help of our demographics section from our survey and the information that gave from our in-depth interviews with a few participants, we were able to create three personas with background information as well as their motivations, goals, and pain points related to the usage of a healthy super app.

## Journey Map
In order to get a better idea of what is going on in the mind of our users, we decided to pick Liam Chan, one of our previous personas, and simulate what the initial experience of getting used to the super app would look like. This would allow us to predict and analyze the high and low points of the potential interactions between a user and the app.

# Design Process
After having better understood the users and the current market, it was time to take the next step and to start thinking about the actual design of the app. Before doing a mockup, we needed to define the logical layout of our app with a user flow diagram. Knowing the possible paths that can be taken in the app is a crucial first step. After that, it would be time to do some rough sketches in order to get an idea of what the different panels would look like. Afterwards, wireframes would solidify our design choices which would then serve as the foundation for the mockup (i.e. the final design). 

## User Flow Diagram
We also decided to include a more human-centered design artefact in order to better visualize a user’s experience with Journey by depicting a typical day in someone’s life while using the super app.

</p>

## Sketches
The sketches are based on user analysis about what needs could user have for a healthy lifestyle super app. The super app will have the following features: map navigation, exercising (workout), cooking with given recipes, a messaging board for sharing thing of interest with other users and a wallet for purchases and additional financial information.

## Wireframes
After having done some rough sketches, it was time to solidify our design choices (and to perhaps rethink some of them if they weren’t solid). One thing that changed from the sketches is that we decided to add credit cards to the wallet.

## Color Palette
The color palette is very simple in terms of colors. Even though different shades of gray are present in the color palette, the prevailing colors in the different shades of green. We think the green color gives a greater sensation of well-being to the user which is very beneficial.

</p>

## Typography
We opted for the Inter font as it represents a more friendly appearance to the user. It is very readable and simple in design. Overall, it gives a nice look to the super app.

</p>

## Naming and Logo
We thought that the name Journey was really what this app was all about: a journey towards living a healthier lifestyle. Because of this, we honestly don’t think that we could’ve come up with a better name than that. Everyone’s journey is different, but we all have the same end goal: to be healthier than we were yesterday. As for the logo itself, the path in the middle signifies the road that one will take on their journey. As for the tree on the bottom left or the mountains on the top right, we wanted this to represent the idea that it doesn’t matter what environment you’re in, living healthy is possible.

# Final Design
After having gone through the process of doing user and market research as well as creating design documents to better clarify the vision of our app, we were finally ready to finalize our app design. Using the knowledge and feedback acquired in the past phases was critical for coming up with a super app design that corresponds to the users’ needs. From the four super apps that we decided to look at (Wechat, Gojek, Grab, Line), we decided to retain four main features which we will explain shortly. Finally, without further ado, here are the main parts of our super app called Journey: <br/>

- Messaging: this is one of the features that was taken from the super apps in the market section. We thought it made sense to also add a way for people to communicate inside our super app which is why we decided to implement a sort of messaging board that is very similar to Reddit. The reason for this feature is that we believed that users would highly benefit from being able to talk to each other and share their advice and progress about their journey towards a healthier lifestyle. From the survey, we understood that the participants cared about being social with one another and this is why a messaging board was something that the app needed.
- Maps: this is another one of the features that was taken from the super apps in the market section. From the survey, users said that going outside and travelling was very important to them and therefore, we had to include this feature. Because this Journey as a focus on living a healthy lifestyle, going outside and visiting new green areas seemed paramount to us and therefore, the maps feature will not only allow users to find their way around, but will also suggest nearby green spaces that they can visit and will tell them their characteristics (i.e. good for children, bird watching, has a basketball court, etc.).
- Cooking: the survey participants strongly believed that healthy cooking is important to them and therefore, we decided to include a module which suggested its users many healthy recipes that they can learn to cook. After all, healthy eating is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle. While browsing recipes, users can decide to buy any missing ingredients which will get shipped right to them (so there is no excuse to not cook that healthy dish now).
Walet: this is another one of the features that was taken from the super apps in the market section. We thought to keep this feature because of the fact that we wanted to allow users to be able to buy ingredients for the suggested cooking recipes.
- Rewards system: this is another one of the features that was taken from the super apps in the market section. From the survey, we saw that a certain amount of people had “rewarding” as a driving force behind their user goals. Therefore, we thought of implementing a points rewards system where the user accumulates points by working out, posting on the message board, visiting places and by buying ingredients and cooking. These points can then be redeemed for real money.
- Exercising: last but not least, the survey suggested that physical health was very important to people. Therefore, we decided to add a module which suggests workouts to users so they can stay in shape.
- Healthy habits helpers: this name is simply an umbrella for three features that can be found on the profiles tab. The first is the app timer which allows users to set a specific timer on an app after which they are forced to quit the app in order to prevent extra unwanted screen time. This is a useful feature that many smartphones operating systems have implemented nowadays and it’s why it made the cut into the app. The second feature is being able to set goals/milestones that one wants to achieve. From our interviews, we saw that one of the features that users wanted to see was the ability to add goals and to be able to track them which is why this feature also made the cut into the app. Finally, the third feature is statistics or metrics tracking. Again, this is one of the features that people during the interviews talked about and wanted to see in a potential healthy super app.

# Conclusion
We had never done a similar project in the past and so this was a quite challenging and rewarding learning experience. Having to go through all the phases of the design after having researched our users and the current market really felt like a fully-fledged project. We realized that talking to people, asking them what they wanted via surveys and interviews was the key to a successful human-design approach to a healthy super app. Understanding people’s concerns was really the most important thing here and once that was done, we really had a blast designing the interfaces knowing that people could have theoretically really made use of this.
